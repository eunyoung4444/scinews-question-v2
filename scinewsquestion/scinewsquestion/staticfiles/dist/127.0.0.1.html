Alter warned in an editorial. </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent24">But the findings of this prospective population-based study do fit with those of experimental studies.</sent> <sent class="normal" id="sent25">In trials involving humans sequestered in research labs, scientists have shown that racking up prolonged, uninterrupted bouts of sitting and lounging cause more worrisome short-term changes in metabolic and cardiovascular function than sedentary behavior that's interrupted by periods of physical activity. </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent26">It only makes sense that those short-term changes translate over time to more profound changes in the risk for diseases linked to sedentary behavior, said Dr. James A. Levine, an obesity expert at the Mayo Clinic who studies the health effects of sitting. </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent27">"If you're sitting too much, you need to do something about it — like right now," Levine said. "Unless you get moving now, you're in trouble later." </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent28">The finding that a workout will not undo the harms caused by prolonged sitting is unsurprising, Levine added. </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent29">"Even if you're a gymgoer and think you're safe on account of your excellent effort, you are not," Levine said.</sent> <sent class="normal" id="sent30">"No one gets away from this stuff. … Excess sitting, this study seems to suggest, is a death sentence." </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent31">In his editorial, Alter worried that people intent on reversing patterns of sedentary behavior will have a lot on their plates. </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent32">To live longer, healthier lives "may require us to count the total number of hours we are sedentary per day, the total number of minutes we sit at a time, the total number of standing breaks we take per hour, the total number of steps we take per day, and the total metabolic equivalent of task-minute volume of exercise we achieve per week," he wrote. </sent><br><br> <sent class="normal" id="sent33">"Yikes! That sure is a lot of counting over the course of a lifetime — all to reverse the evolutionary patterns of a society gone lazy," Alter added.</sent> <sent class="normal" id="sent34">"Might it not just be easier to return to our origins as hunters and gatherers?"</sent></div>
