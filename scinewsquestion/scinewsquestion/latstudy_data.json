  "article_title": "Data science reveals vitamin B cancer risk",
  "article_body": "New research, based on big data analytics, has drawn a connection between cancer and taking high quantities of B vitamins. The research additionally shows the advantages of data driven science. <br><br>The research is based on a review of medical records over the long-term. It looks at patterns of smoking, dosing with B vitamins, and lung cancer. The research focuses on men, and the headline statement is that men, aged between 50 and 76 years, who smoked and took large doses of vitamins B6 or B12 significantly increased their risk of lung cancer.<br><br>Boiling down the research into more detail, the study found that men who took high doses of vitamin B6 (with 'high' being defined as 20 milligrams or more per day) increased their likelihood, in they were smokers, of developing lung cancer by more than 30 percent. This involved taking B6 over a ten year period. The analysis of the same data set found that when the same target group took 55 micrograms of B12 each day increased the likelihood of developing lung cancer by more than 40 percent. This was over a similar ten year period. <br> <br>The data was drawn from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database. This data gathering exercise began in 1973 and it assembles data related to cancer incidence and survival from people based across the U.S. Recent advances in digitalization and big data analytics have allowed new and varied patterns to be drawn from the database.<br><br>The reason why this data review is important is that although the levels of B vitamins consumed exceeded the recommended allowances in most countries, there is a developing tendency with some people to 'overdose' on B vitamins, under the assumption that this helps to boost energy levels or lower cholesterol.<br> <br>The reason for the association, according to lead researcher Dr. Theodore Brasky, from The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, is because excessive B vitamin consumption interferes with the way the body makes new DNA and repairs existing DNA within the pathway that can allow lung cancer to spread.</sent><sent> As the researcher told Popular Science: \u201cWhen you disrupt this pathway, it stands to reason that there can be consequences.\" The study is, however, based on association and the population analyzed were from the U.S. only. Further data analytics looking at other surveys will be needed to confirm or deny the observations.<br><br>The data science based research is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study is titled \"Long-Term, Supplemental, One-Carbon Metabolism\u2013Related Vitamin B Use in Relation to Lung Cancer Risk in the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) Cohort.\"",

  "article_title": "High dose vitamin B supplements linked to lung cancer in smokers",
  "article_body": "A\u00a0report published in the\u00a0Journal of Clinical Oncology\u00a0shows that male smokers who took high dose vitamin B6 and B12 supplements \u2013 often marketed as energy boosters and present in energy drinks \u2013 had three to four times the risk of developing lung cancer, compared to men who did not take the vitamin B supplements. The same effect was not seen in women.<br><br> \u201cHigh dose supplements should not be taken for lung cancer prevention and in fact may increase risk of the disease in men,\u201d the authors conclude.<br><br> But while the study shows a worrisome link, it also has weaknesses. \u201cIt could be an association by chance,\u201d says Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at the Sansom Institute of the University of South Australia.<br><br>  Even the primary author does not believe the data should be interpreted to mean there is a causal link. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that the link is causal; it\u2019s important to me that the study is replicated,\u201d says Theodore Brasky, now at Ohio State University.<br><br> Vitamin B supplements are marketed as boosting energy. Often they come at extraordinarily high doses. The recommended daily allowance for vitamin B6 for men is only about one and a half milligrams, and for vitamin B12, it\u2019s less than two and a half micrograms per day. \u201cBut if you look at these supplement bottles, they\u2019re being sold in pill form at up to 5,000 micrograms per dose, which is much, much higher than the daily recommended amount,\u201d said Brasky. \u201cEnergy drinks like Monster can carry up to 80 times the RDA of B vitamins.\u201d<br><br> When it comes to the science, the reports on taking supplements of B vitamins are mixed. For instance, in 2010\u00a0a large European study called EPIC\u00a0found that higher blood levels of B6 were associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. On the other hand,\u00a0a 2009 Norwegian study\u00a0that gave high doses of vitamin B supplements to patients with pre-existing heart disease for up to 39 months found that it raised the risk of lung cancer. In this case, the vitamins used were folate (B9) and Vitamin B12.<br><br> The study on which this report is based specifically set out to explore the links between various types of supplements \u2013 vitamins, minerals and herbal extracts \u2013 and cancer.<br><br> Known by its acronym VITAL (vitamins and lifestyle), it involved sending questionnaires to people across 13 counties in Washington State during the period 2000\u20132002. Some 77,118 participants aged between 50 and 76 were asked to detail their diets and use of supplements over the previous ten years. Their personal data was also recorded including age, education, gender, ethnicity, height and weight, medical history and history of smoking.<br><br> The researchers also had access to a cancer registry that serviced the same area. They followed the group for six years.<br><br> The main findings were that men who had taken a high dose of vitamin B6 greater than 20 mg per day for ten years (the recommended daily allowance is 1.7mg/day) were at an 80% higher risk of lung cancer.<br><br> When it came to Vitamin B12, those who had taken greater than 55 micrograms per day (RDA is 2.5 micrograms per day) were at a 98% greater risk of lung cancer.<br><br> Women did not show an increased risk.<br><br> Most of the risk was linked to men who were active smokers throughout the period. Their risk was three to four times higher if they were taking high-dose supplements.<br><br> So does this mean the vitamin supplements caused these cancers?\u00a0Not necessarily.<br><br> Studies of this kind can easily create spurious associations. For instance, it could be that those people who took supplements had good reason to worry about lung cancer. Perhaps they were smokers or had a family history or perhaps their workplaces or residences put them at risk. These people would also be more motivated to volunteer for a study on supplements and cancer.\u00a0<br><br>\u2028 Though the VITAL questionnaire attempted to dissect out possible confounding factors, it did not specifically ask about peoples\u2019 workplace or domestic exposures to pollutants.<br><br> \u201cThe thing that worries me most is that the VITAL study was looking for an association between 13 types of vitamins and over 120 different types of cancer. This means that many associations found could be completely by chance,\u201d says Esterman. \u201c And they did not collect data on passive smoking, or occupational exposure, so they could not adjust for two major potential confounding factors for lung cancer.\u201d<br><br> Besides the limitations of the study, is there a plausible biological mechanism that would explain why excess use of B vitamins is linked to cancer?<br><br> The authors point to the fact that vitamin B6 and B12 are involved in the so-called \u201cone carbon pathway\u201d that is crucial for synthesizing and regulating DNA. Exposure to such high levels could disrupt the regulation of cell growth and lead to cancer. But if the effect is real, why was it not seen with women?<br><br> The authors suggest that male hormones might affect the way the B vitamins interact with the one carbon pathway.<br><br> So what\u2019s to be drawn from this study?<br><br> \u201cIf I was a male smoker in this age range, I\u2019d probably cut back \u2013 just in case,\u201d says Esterman.<br><br> In any event, says Brasky, \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get all the vitamin B you need in this country, from eating meats, chickpeas and foods like cereal that are fortified with them, so there really is no reason to supplement your vitamin B intake at these levels, and certainly not for years on end.\u201d",

  "article_body": "Men\u00a0who take energy-boosting vitamin B supplements could be at double the risk of lung\u00a0cancer.<br><br> A study found men who take high doses of vitamins B6 or B12 over a long period were much more likely to develop the disease.<br><br>If they also smoked, their risk of cancer was up to four times higher if they took the supplements.<br><br> The body needs vitamins B6 and B12 to help ensure red blood cells are healthy and to process proteins, fat and carbohydrate.<br><br> They are naturally found in meat, fish, cheese, eggs and milk, as well as fortified breakfast cereals, but millions of people in the UK take supplements as well.<br><br> Vitamin B6 and B12 pills are often marketed as energy or metabolism-boosting products.<br><br> The NHS-recommended dose for vitamin B6 is around 1.4mg (milligrams) a day for men and 1.2mg a day for women, while for B12 it is 1.5mcg (micrograms) a day for adults. <br><br> But tablets available on the high street in the UK can contain as much as 100mg of B6 and 500mcg of B12.<br><br> For the study, researchers in the U.S. followed 77,000 people aged between 50 and 76 as part of the Vital (Vitamins and Lifestyle) study - a major US investigation into the impact of vitamins and minerals on cancer risk.<br><br> Participants provided detailed information about their B-vitamin use over the past 10 years, including what dose they took.<br><br> Previously, doctors had thought supplements could help reduce cancer risk.<br><br> But they found men who took high doses of vitamin B6 and B12 for ten years were at a higher risk of cancer \u2013 even when factors like age, smoking history, family history of cancer and alcohol consumption were taken into account.<br><br> Male smokers who took more than 20mg of B6 a day for 10 years were three times more likely to develop lung cancer than people who did not take supplements.<br><br> The risk was four times greater for male smokers taking at least 55 micrograms of B12 a day for 10 years.<br><br> But there was no similar risk in women who took the supplements.<br><br> Study lead Dr Theodore Brasky, of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Centre, said: \u2018What we found was that men who had used dietary supplements, in particular B6 and vitamin B12, at high doses for 10 years, were at significant increased risk of developing lung cancer.<br><br> \u2018In fact, all men who used these supplements in high doses for a decade had approximately double the risk developing lung cancer, and in men who smoked, the risk was three to four times as great.\u2019<br><br> He warned many vitamin B supplements contained doses which were \u2018much, much higher than the daily recommended amount\u2019.<br><br> \u2018It\u2019s very easy to get all the vitamin B you need from eating meats, chickpeas and foods like cereal that are fortified with them, so there really is no reason to supplement your vitamin B intake at these levels, and certainly not for years on end,\u2019 he added.<br><br> But he said most multivitamin tablets did not contain such high doses so taking those daily should not have the same effect.<br><br> Further studies will now examine whether the same effect is seen in post-menopausal women or whether it only affects men.<br><br> The research, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, is the latest to challenge the alleged health benefits of vitamin supplements.<br><br> Excessive doses of vitamin E, beta-carotene and folic acid (vitamin B9) have all previously been linked to increased cancer risk.<br><br> The Health Food Manufacturers\u2019 Association (HFMA) said the observational study was \u2018unreliable\u2019 as it relied on people\u2019s memories.<br><br> A spokesman said: \u2018The association was only found with very high intakes when taken over a period of 10 years, and especially in smokers, and therefore does not apply to more typical vitamin users.<br><br> \u2018No link at all was found in women. Current safety assessments of micronutrients in both the UK and the EU do not identify data linking B12 or B6 with cancer development.\u2019",
